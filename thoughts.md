My thoughts on these 5 programming languages: C, ARM, Smalltalk, Clojure, Swift

---

In this paper I would like to talk about my experiences with 5 programming languages that we have learnt so far in the class, discuss their strengths and weaknesses and compare them all together.

The first language that we talked about was C. Since writing a "Hello World" program was simple, I had an immediate impression that C was very simple and minimal. I then took that program and expanded its functionality so that it could ask for an user's name from stdin and print out the greeting. Finding the built-in function from the core library to read user's input was simple enough, though providing needed parameters was not so clear. Apparently, scanf had a lot of format specifiers to choose from and configure. This made me realize that, even though C was minimal, it was super powerful and flexible. After finishing reading from the input, I needed to figure out a way to store that into a variable and print it out to the terminal. There was no string data type type that I could find. That said, the way was to initialize a char type variable with fix-length and use that to store the input since string was made of char anyway. The next program that I wrote was to ask user to input two integers and then a sum would be printed out. Since I already knew how to use scanf to read user's input, it was straightforward to use it again to ask for integer though this time, I needed to store them in a integer variable. Calculating the sum and printing it out was easy enough. Then I moved on to calculate the sum of 3 integers, the average, maximum and minimum. This time I learnt about array and function. I made 4 functions to calculate the sum, average, max and min of 3 integers where they take in an array of size 3 as their parameters. An interesting about functions in C was that they were all needed to be defined in the beginning of files or in separate header files. I liked it a lot since it provided more readability for developers themselves as well as reviewers. Moving on to calculating the median and mode was more challenging. To calculate the mean, I had to implement a sorting algorithm to sort the array first then pick the middle value. I chose to implement selection sort since it was pretty easy to understand and implement. Though it took sometimes, I was able to do it. To calculate the mode, I planned to use a hashmap to store the key-value pairs of characters and their number of occurrences. However, that was not the case since there was no built-in hashmap data structure in C's core library. That said, I had two options to either implement my own hashmap then use it or look for other solution. I then found a solution that implement counting sort that was a good fit, implemented it and had it worked. I then learnt to appreciate hashmap more after spending a lot of time solving that one. Overall, I thought that C was a good language. It was simple yet powerful. Even though it did not support a lot of handy core library as Go and Python, it was pretty easy to use and understand. Once C was used carefully, it would suppose to be super fast and efficient.

The second language that we learnt was ARM. There was no way to implement a "Hello World" program so I moved on to playing with addition problem. The commands in ARM were pretty limited as they were all low-level system calls. There were also a handful of registers that I could use to store my data on. In order to add two integers, I had to first declare these values as words in memory, move/store addresses in registers, load values from these addresses, add them together and store them back again in registers. Unlike C, Go or Python, in order to add two numbers, I couldn't simply use a "+" symbol and have them added together. I had to followed a set of instructions to grab these values at their addresses and add them manually using a primitive ADD method. I was really fascinated by this and also grateful for the fact that C and other modern programming languages abstracted all of these behind-the-scene addition for us. I then tried to implement multiplication for 2 numbers by adding one a number of times. I learnt to use branching to implement a loop with a counter so I could repeatedly add a number of times. After I had it worked, I took on a challenge to use bit manipulation to implement multiplication instead. That was then I learnt about bitwise AND and bit shifting. It took me more than 4 hours to implement everything together to make it run. It was a long journey but I did learn a lot from it. Later on, I tried to implement bubble sort using a stack pointer, though I was able to only had it worked partly. Again, I enjoyed the progress a lot as it helped me understand the low-level instruction of a program. I thought that using ARM was a good way to learn about computer system, but not so fun to quickly prototype things.
